# AWS Lambda Example

Backend:
A Typescript express web server which allows you to run locally and deployed on AWS with Lambdas

This is a project for deploying an express server on an AWS Lambda.

Eventually, I hope that it becomes an easy template to fork a new web project off. I have previously been setting everything up on a DigitalOcean droplet, but having to configure the ufw firewall and nginx server to allow multiple domains was/is a bit cumbersome. So I hope that this becomes the new way forward.
